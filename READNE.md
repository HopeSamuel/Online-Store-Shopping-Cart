This is a simple online store featuring a functional shopping cart that has been created using HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, JSON and jQuery.

The shopping cart is an essential part of an online store experience as it provides a summary of the added products and the totals. Online shoppers can view what they are wanting to buy, as well as the totals, and select preferred options all in one place.

The goal is to enable a convenient, user-friendly and informative shopping cart for an online store. This also allows for the user to input important information that is necessary to complete an online order.
